# Mado

> A window opens,  
> not to the past, but to presence —  
> to the shifting breath of the web.
>
> On the surface of the rain,  
> old skins stir and shimmer.  
> **Shigure** guides each drop  
> through Rainmeter’s frame,  
> like footsteps where no path was laid,  
> vanishing as they fall.
>
> Beneath the roots of the system,  
> in lands no sun touches,  
> **Yomi** carries the code  
> across iron walls and rituals,  
> traced by a hand  
> that moves between worlds unseen.
>
> In the stillness of breath,  
> between event and intent,  
> **Iki** whispers —  
> the pulse that animates all form,  
> unseen but ever moving.
>
> And in the forge of the free,  
> where nothing is given  
> and all must be shaped,  
> **Takumi** builds without fear —  
> each line a hammer-strike,  
> each thread woven with fire.
>
> This is **Mado** —  
> not a window,  
> but a world.
